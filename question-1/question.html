<p class="intro-text">
  On Youtube word-salads are a fact. Now techniques used are not always so shameless, but neither completely neat. Starting from Social Blade, we went through the list of top channels’ videos for kids. Looking at the titles of those channels, that own billions of views and followers and that earn millions of dollars per year, recurrences were perceived. The effect was reading the same lines thousands of times, even if constructed in different ways ▎

<div class="main-text-title"><h3>Main findings</h3></div>
<div class="main-text">
  <p>In a period of around one month, taking in consideration each channels’ latest 25 videos, the amount of repetitions detected is huge. Some words have been used hundreds of times. Those are distributed between different channels: if not a matter of copy, for sure a strategy.</p>

  <p>Repetition is visible not only between channels, but even in consequential titles of one single channel and sometimes in the same title itself. Hiding underlined parts in the visualisation, very few words remain.</p>
    <p class="border"> <img src="find2.png"/> </p>
  <hr />
  <p>It is interesting to see that many of those words are also used in channels’ names, an excuse to use them in the context of any phrase to remark video property while pleasing the algorithm.</p>

  <hr />
  <p>Some words are frequently used together, in combination or coupled, in the same line, like “kids”, “song” and “nursery rhymes”, or “pretend” followed by “play”.</p>

  <p>It is possible to argue that some of those words could change over time following periodic trends, to match most popular queries: in this case, since the period studied stands between October and November, the word “halloween” is therefore used with high frequency.</p>
